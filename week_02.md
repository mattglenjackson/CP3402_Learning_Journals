## Content Insights
- Learning about two different CMS's this week was challenging but an interesting experience. I think overall if I was doing this as a web developer I'd be more
inclined to use WordPress as it seems way more intuitive to work with. However, learning how to re-create my static website from week_01 in Joomla was beneficial in understanding
how to get familiar with Joomla, which will be valuable in helping me get started with Assignment_01. 
- I did find it difficult to make the website look similar to my week_01 website as Joomla has a lot of default settings that make the website ugly. The videos I watched on LinkedIn Learning about
Joomla told me to focus on the content side of things first before worrying about the design aspects which I think is a good approach that can be applied to all CMS's and I will remember
that going into Assignment_01.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- Spent some time this week setting up Vagrant and VirtualBox on my computers. I did this ahead of time to avoid any issues the upcoming weeks and make sure I was prepared ahead of time before running into issues closer towards due dates.
- One thing I found out this week was Joomla 5.0.2 doesn't seem to work on scotch-box 3.5 because Joomla 5.0.2 requires a newer version of PHP to run.
I did manage to find different LAMP stack called Cognac Box (https://github.com/reddingwebpro/cognacbox) which has similar but newer features and allows Joomla 5.0.2 to run on it.
This is great for me because I can use everything I learnt this week through this prac for Assignment_01 without having to use out of date software which could create issues. 
- This also allowed me to gain some additional experience with stuff I am unfamiliar with and would not have gotten that experience if I just decided
to install an older version of Joomla on my localhost without persisting to get the newest version to work.
