## Content Insights
- Using Child themes helps speed up the process of web development, and keeps the functionality of the parent theme intact which is super important even if you don't intend to use the catalogue of features.
- I can eliminate displaying things on a child themes by using css parameter display:none; and targeting the Class or ID of the element. It's something that I haven't used much in the past, but knowing that now will make me a better web developer and will prevent me from breaking website functionality.  

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- I think the biggest thing I learn this week was what I did in Assignment_01 by deleting lots of stuff from a parent theme is an in efficient way of doing things that will result broken websites as you try to implement more complex content and features. 
- I actually got super frustrated by the end of Assignment_01 as I spent more time mucking around with themes than I thought I would initially. I also lost my Joomla site to the mistake by not checking backups earlier on in the piece and just assumed it was okay.
- This resulted in me having to re-do the Joomla site from scratch, which wasn't ideal and I had to submit the assignment later than I would have liked. I guess what I can learn from this is backups are super important, and making sure it's possible at the beginning of web dev project is beneficial. 
- Another benefit of that mistake is I got some extra experience with Joomla that I didn't expect to get in the first place, and although I was re-creating what I had already done once before, the fact that it was way faster the second time around showed me that I had learnt more than I initially thought.
