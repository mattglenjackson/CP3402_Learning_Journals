## Content Insights
- Using Child themes helps speed up the process of web development, and keeps the functionality of the parent theme intact which is super important even if you don't intend to use the catalogue of features.
- I can eliminate displaying things on a child themes by using css parameter display:none; and targeting the Class or ID of the element. It's something that I haven't used much in the past, but knowing that now will make me a better web developer and will prevent me from breaking website functionality.
