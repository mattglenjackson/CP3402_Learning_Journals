- This week I spent some time getting more familiar with PHP and how it works within WordPress.
- I learnt this week that Windows terminals do not support SSH connections like Mac or Linux terminals. This was something I wasn't familiar with, and had to spend some extra time learning how to use PuTTY to connect to my Lightsail web server.
- I also learned about the importance of SSH for connecting to web servers securely. SSH is crucial because it establishes a secure connection between your local computer and the remote server. This connection is authenticated through the exchange of cryptographic keys, ensuring that the server's identity can be verified and that the data exchanged during the session remains confidential.
- By connecting though SSH onto my server I was able to learn how to create databases within MyPhpAdmin and how to use PHP code to read database tables and to display the table using shortcode by editing the function.php file within the theme I was using. I don't know if it will end up being useful in this subject, but it did provide me with a better understanding of PHP syntax.
