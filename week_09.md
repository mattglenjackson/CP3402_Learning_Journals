# Week 09 Learning Journal

## Learning Activities & Resources
- Watched LinkedIn Learning Videos
- Spent heaps of time working on our group project which was very helpful in learning how to use SASS.

## Estimated Hours
- 12 hours

## Content Insights
- Setting up SASS stuff for the first time is time-consuming, but once it is set up, it is very easy to use and help with productivity. After setting it up once, the next time will be much faster and easier.   
- The ability to use nested styling makes more sense to me than the old way of doing things in CSS, and I find that I spend less time trying to figure out how to style things the way I want them to look. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- This week I learn how to add customisation to themes using PHP. This was something that was tough, and took lots of time. But figuring out how it works will help me add more customisation to themes in other ways in the future. 
- This week for the prac I decided to use a combination of PHP to create basic webpages and use SCSS to style it. This helped me reinforce what I have learnt through the group project so far and was done relatively fast, proving that what I have been learning over the passed few weeks has stuck.
