## Content Insights
- Security is important when developing websites. Some people might just attempt to attack your site just because they can. Making sure your site isn't the lowest hanging fruit can significantly reduce your risk of running into security issues.
- Most people default to having security as an after-thought until they have first-hand experience with the problem.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- The passed 10 weeks has taught me a lot of skills in both the technical and team management side of the deal.
- Constantly checking up on people can be annoying, but sometimes it's the only way to make sure tasks are completed on time.
- Even into the last few hours of the project I learnt that you can apply your own custom CSS classes to the block editor in WordPress to pin-point specific areas on your site with styling.
