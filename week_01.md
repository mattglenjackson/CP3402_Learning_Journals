# Week 01 Learning Journal

## Learning Activities & Resources
- Attended Seminar.
- Attended Prac Class.

- Used W3schools for refreshers on HTML and CSS syntax, best practises and attributes to target and display content 
correctly.
- Completed the revision quiz from the slides.

## Estimated Hours
- 8 hours

## Content Insights
- The prac this week showed me that I had forgotten a lot of the HTML and CSS I learnt in CP1406.
- I do not have much experience with Javascript and will probably need to make time in the upcoming weeks to get better 
at using it in website situations since the LinkedIn learning activity that involved it wasn't as straight forward as 
HTML and CSS areas.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- First thing I did was go through the resources link on the GitHub page to set up everything required for the subject.
- My initial idea was to go with the quickest way to get started, and revise the other processes mentioned over the next 
few weeks to see if there are options which work better for me. But this week I felt it was more important to get up and
running and worry about the best ways later.
- Spending time going back and revisiting familiar content is important when you haven't used it in a while.
- Looked for my own way to host my websites pages on the internet. I initially thought I was supposed to do it through
AWS lightsail, but realised that it did not seem to fit the requirements of the prac due to not editing the HTML or CSS.
Decided to revise my process and find a different way to host my website. I ended up using netlify as it was an easy way
to achieve what I wanted to achieve and also free.
- As I now try to submit the prac LearnJCU is down. I purposely delayed handing in this prac to enjoy the weekend. It may
not be wise to attempt this later in the subject.
