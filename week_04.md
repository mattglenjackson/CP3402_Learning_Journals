## Content Insights
- Mucking around in both WordPress and Joomla this week, I have a new appreciation for Joomla. Initially I dismissed it, but I did find that because there is less to muck around with CSS wise, website content is much easier to keep consistent.
- I still think WordPress is the better CMS for me, but I initially thought I'd have a harder time in Joomla which didn't necessarily be the case in the end.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- I learnt that being able to back-up your website is super important. I lost my Joomla website this week trying to update a theme and didn't have a backup to restore it.
- The limitation of not being able to get a backup initially due to the hosting service not allowing it because it was free. Going forward I will make sure that I try to back-up stuff earlier to make sure not so much progress is lost.
- From finishing off the assignment this week I learnt how to use FTP to download website backup files through LightSail.
