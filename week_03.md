## Content Insights
- From this week I learnt how localhosts can be an advantage to web developers. It highlighted for me, the importance of having an environment to test your website instead of publishing content straight onto the internet.
- Although it may not get covered in this subject, I believe this would be a viable way to test security features and making sure they are as airtight as possible before releasing problematic pages onto the internet.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- This week I was able to use my previous weeks experience mucking around with the localhost and LAMP stacks. The lessons I learned in the previous weeks
were also beneficial with helping others who had problems getting their localhost environments to work.
- The biggest problem this week when I talked to other students, was getting localhost LAMP stacks installed on their host machines. Using the knowledge I had gained previously I was able to help people understand where their problems were and help practise my communication skills to guide them in the correct direction to achieve their goals.
- From the interviews this week, I learnt that a lot of people were interested in people's availablity schedules in regard to forming teams for Assignment_02. It made me realise people want other people in their team who can work on similar schedules to get the work done.
- The questions I personally asked were more about getting people to try and identify what their strengths and weaknesses are when working in a team environment. I found most people were able to answer their strengths way faster than their weaknesses which makes sense. But asking the weakness question gave me a good understanding of how honest people wanted to be, which is something I personally value above most other traits as I find teams work best when people are open with communication and are not afraid to ask for help when they need it.
- Knowing peoples weakness ahead of time can also allow for better planning with tasks and allow an overall better team dynamic.
